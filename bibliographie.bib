    abstract = {{Nowadays, real-time editing systems are catching on. Tools
                  such as Etherpad or Google Docs enable multiple authors at
                  dispersed locations to collaboratively write shared
                  documents. In such systems, a replication mechanism is
                  required to ensure consistency when merging concurrent
                  changes performed on the same document. Current editing
                  systems make use of operational transformation (OT), a
                  traditional replication mechanism for concurrent document
                  editing. Recently, Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)
                  were introduced as a new class of replication mechanisms
                  whose concurrent operations are designed to be natively
                  commutative. CRDTs, such as WOOT, Logoot, Treedoc, and RGAs,
                  are expected to be substitutes of replication mechanisms in
                  collaborative editing systems. This paper demonstrates the
                  suitability of CRDTs for real-time collaborative editing. To
                  reflect the tendency of decentralised collaboration, which
                  can resist censorship, tolerate failures, and let users have
                  control over documents, we collected editing logs from
                  real-time peer-to-peer collaborations. We present our
                  experiment results obtained by replaying those editing logs
                  on various CRDTs and an OT algorithm implemented in the same
                  environment.}},

    abstract = {{Eventual consistency aims to ensure that replicas of some
                  mutable shared object converge without foreground
                  synchronisation. Previous approaches to eventual consistency
                  are ad-hoc and error-prone. We study a principled approach:
                  to base the design of shared data types on some simple formal
                  conditions that are sufficient to guarantee eventual
                  consistency. We call these types Convergent or Commutative
                  Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). This paper formalises
                  asynchronous object replication, either state based or
                  operation based, and provides a sufficient condition
                  appropriate for each case. It describes several useful CRDTs,
                  including container data types supporting both \add and
                  \remove operations with clean semantics, and more complex
                  types such as graphs, montonic DAGs, and sequences. It
                  discusses some properties needed to implement non-trivial
                  CRDTs.}},
